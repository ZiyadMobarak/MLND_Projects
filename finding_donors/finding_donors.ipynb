    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like.

    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree \n",
    "    - Acceptance criteria in universities, where you have multiple conditions and for a student to be accepted he must pass all the conditions\n",
    "    - There are many strengths for the decision tree. First of all, you can address many of the features using the decision tree, and it can address both categorical and continous data. In addition to that, Decision tree won't cost that much for training, and there are some well defined techniques to find the optimal decision tree such as calculating the Entropy. Furthermore, it can deal with incomplete or noisy data. \n",
    "    - There are some weaknesses for the decision tree. First of all, it might be sensitive to data when training. Changing one some of the values might give you a totally different decision tree. Furthremore, it depends heavily on the hyper-parameters. Setting some of the limits on the hyper-parameters such as the maximum depeth of the decision tree might result a totally different calssification. However, the complexity of the decision tree grows fast and we might end up having a very large and complex decision tree that would be hard to prune and maintain.   \n",
    "    - This model will be a good candidate because we have many categorical columns, and all columns can be easily divided to multiple options. Therefore, training the model for this data won't be challanging. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "    - Detecting faults in machines, where the prediction model will take many features and predict whether the machine is proparly working or not from the given features. \n",
    "    - The random forest is combining multiple decision trees. Therefore, it will give more accurate predictions and they we'll be more rebust to data training and not as sensitive as decision trees. Furthermore, we don't need to tune many parameters. \n",
    "    - However, due to having multiple trees, this means training time won't be similar to having only one decision tree. Furthermore, we the risk of having overfitting will increase. \n",
    "    - Similar to the decision tree, this model will be good candidate for our problem because we have many categorical columns and they can be divided to muliple options and having multiple trees voting for the same prediction will increase the accuracy of our predictions. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "    - SVM has many applications and one of the known applications is determining whether an email is spam or not. \n",
    "    - It has many advantages and the main two advantages is the flexibility to determine the threshold which means that you can tune the model to avoid over or underfitting. Furthermore, you can use the Kernal Trick to address very complex problems with very high dimensions. It is more rebust against nosiy points. \n",
    "    - Some of the disadvantages is the long training time for large datasets (computationally expensive!). Furthermore, it might not do well if the noisy points are within the boundries.  \n",
    "    - This model might be a good candidate because we can eliminate the effect of noisy points that are outside the threshold which might affect income predictions. When predicting incomes, for sure we'll have some people which are outliers and shouldn't be used to predict incomes as they are special cases. Furthermore , if we couldn't seperate some of the features categories, we can use the Kernal Trick to introduce a new dimension which will help us more in predicting the income. \n"

    "I won't choose the SVM for sure because it performs the worst on the training dataset and when the training size reduced to 1%, it performs badly on the testing dataset comparing to the other two classifiers. The decision tree and random forest are both suitable for the data but as we can see, the decision tree little bit overfit the training data and this is why it performs the best on the training dataset and not the best on the testing dataset. Therefore, I would choose the Random Forest because it tend not to overfit the training dataset, and had a better accouracy and F-score than the Decision Tree in all testing cases.  "

    "Random Forest is nothing but a combination of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is a classifier by itself, and Random Forest average the predicitons from all the trees to get a better accuracy. Furthermore, having many Decision Trees to average predictions will help us not overfitting the model on the training dataset. \n",

    "So basically what happens is that the Random Forest will sample n from the dataset and create a decision tree from the given features we have (education, sex ...etc.). After that, it will start sampling again from the whole dataset including the points being used to create the first decision tree and then create another classifier from the same features. It will continue creating m decision trees. Finally when start predicting the salary of each person, it will predict from all trees, and then it will average (in other words votings) the results to get the final prediction which the Random Forest prediction. \n",

As the age increase, the experiance and the promotion of a person probabilty become high, which means the income most probabilty is higher. For the relationship, also it does make sense because a person won't be involved in a relaitionship unless his/her financial status is settled which contribute heavily to the income. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
